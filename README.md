# Smashing.cat

This repo holds all code for the [http://smashing.cat](smashing.cat) project.

## A few things to mention

I am loading a stylesheet with the font-face declarations and the woff2 versions of the fontfiles with `preload` in order to have them as soon as possible in supporting browsers.

At the end of the body I'm using `loadCSS` and the `preload polyfill` by Filament Group in order to be safe with my assumptions made in the `<head>`. If JS fails or is disabled I have the `fonts.min.css` inside a `<noscript>` block.

Apart from that it's mostly straight-forward. I'm using the sizes attribute for the `<img>` element in order to provide an SVG to capable browsers with a PNG fallback for all the others.

In the CSS I'm working with a few different mediaqueries to keep a reasonable, readable experience on spot for as many devices and viewport-sizes as possible.

## Using Gulp

I set up Gulp for this respository in order to learn how to use it for basic front end development. The workflow is not ideal yet and something with the LESS processing is off because I had to dismiss my `variables` file. Also when running browser-sync the watch task does nothing â€“ just like "ze goggles"!

I'm using the following plugins (s. package.json file for the exact versions):

- autoprefixer
- browser-sync
- cssnano
- gulp-cache
- gulp-htmlmin
- gulp-imagemin
- gulp-less
- gulp-postcss
- gulp-uglify
